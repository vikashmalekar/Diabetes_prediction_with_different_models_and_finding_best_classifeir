# Diabetes_prediction_with_different_models_and_finding_best_classifeir
Diabetes is a pronic disease. Predicting this at an early stage may help us to take remedies and measures which will help in controlling disease. This project is all about predicting diabetes with different machine learning classification models. And finally finding which model predicted with high accuracy( finding the best classifier)
